"],["data.html", "2 Data", " 2 Data Horse population data were sourced from the Government of Canadaâ€™s Open Data website (Government of Canada, 2017a and Government of Canada, 2017b).

"],["results.html", "4 Results", " 4 Results Figure 4.1: Historical number of horses per province in Canada Figure 4.1: Horse populations for all provinces in Canada from 1906 - 1972 We can see from Figure 1 that Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta have had the highest horse populations in Canada. All provinces have had a decline in horse populations since 1940. This is likely due to the rebound of the Canadian automotive industry after the Great Depression and the Second World War. An interesting follow-up visualisation would be car sales per year for each Province over the time period visualised above to further support this hypothesis. Suppose we were interested in looking in more closely at the province with the highest spread (in terms of standard deviation) of horse populations. We present the standard deviations here: Table 4.1: sample standard deviation of number of horses Province Std Saskatchewan 377265.58 Ontario 266435.32 Alberta 266063.19 Manitoba 122403.87 Quebec 111411.10 New Brunswick 22019.49 Nova Scotia 19879.25 British Columbia 14945.66 P.E.I. 11355.75 Note that we define standard deviation (of a sample) as \\[s = sqrt( sum_{i = 1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x}) / (n-1))\\] Additionally, note that in Table 4.1 we consider the sample standard deviation of the number of horses during the same time span as Figure 4.1. Figure 4.2: historical number of horses in Saskatchewan Figure 4.2: Horse populations for the province with the largest standard deviation In Figure 4.2 we zoom in and look at the province of Saskatchewan, which had the largest spread of values in terms of standard deviation.
